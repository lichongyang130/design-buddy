# Reference-led collection rebuild

## New user-authorised scope

On 2026-10-29 the user requested a new rebuild, not recovery of the missing prior binaries. Each case must now contain **28–35 pages and 15–20 independently generated main illustrations**. This replaces the earlier 28–40-page allowance. The latest attached kitchen image is the background/style reference: warm ivory paper, pale sage surroundings, delicate ink contours and soft natural watercolour. It supersedes the prior dark-background direction for this new batch. Each case must have a genuinely distinct framework. Preserve native gallery rail/sidebar/filter/workspace behaviour and existing user work storage.

Target remains 56 cases. Legacy bulk sources are retained, not used to populate the rebuilt gallery. Prior MEASURE/CORNER LIBRARY/FOOTFALL/AFTER HOURS originals remain unrecovered; this batch must not be described as recovery of those files.

## Actual progress

**Published: 2 / 56. Drafts: 0. Not started: 54. Authored pages: 64. Actual independent main illustrations: 32 / 32. Missing primary art: 0.**

PANTRY NOTES is a new 32-page kitchen-measurement learning journal. All 16 genuine primary illustrations are present. The final six show equal-group planning, comparison of observation notes, provenance review, method handoff, careful revision and a closing notebook still life. All 32 pages show their assigned primary illustration; no pending-art diagram remains. Repeated placements do not increase the independent primary-art count. The case is published after browser, offline, cache, export and real Office checks passed.

The framework is a specimen window, observation/method margin and reflection strip. Mobile uses full-width stacked art and readable prose, not a tiny desktop screenshot. Text and a private note save under a separate local key. Current HTML and JSON exports preserve edits; original PDF/PPTX do not change with browser edits. All numerical examples are fictional arithmetic, not readings from the illustrated scale/jug, cooking instructions, calibration, nutrition or safety advice.

Final PDF has 32 pages. Final PPTX has 32 slides with native editable text and all 16 primary raster illustrations. Historical `pantry-notes-preview.pdf` and `.pptx` URLs remain compatible; download filenames are `pantry-notes.pdf` and `.pptx`. Source ZIP opens directly with `file://`, includes all 16 illustrations and a bundled viewer, and can generate self-contained current HTML. Original PDF/PPTX are separate downloads, not duplicated in the source archive. File-origin storage can be unavailable; use exports to retain edits.

## OPEN SHELF — second case (published)

The second case contains 32 authored spatial concept boards, not a recoloured notebook. Its distinct structure combines a full-width proposal heading, responsibility strip, conceptual zoning map, watercolor scene, lower evidence/action columns and per-board local review marks. Native PPTX exports include editable zoning shapes and text; primary watercolor art remains raster. The diagram is not to scale and is not construction, accessibility, safety, privacy, procurement or operational approval.

All 16 independent warm-ivory/pale-sage illustrations are present. The final six show specialist-question review, unresolved planning notes, source review, private draft discussion, a bounded notebook handoff and a closing project still life. All 32 boards now use their assigned main illustration; no pending-art map remains. The case is published after all acceptance gates pass. Historical `open-shelf-preview.pdf`/`.pptx` paths remain compatible; download filenames omit `preview`. Local review values are open/revise/discuss/defer, not official approval, and are saved separately for each board under a separate case key. Edits, note and review marks survive current HTML/JSON export and direct-file offline use. Original PDF/PPTX remain unchanged by browser edits.

The resource model is fictional: 1,800 + 1,400 + 600 + 400 = 4,200 units; adding 800 gives 5,000. Staffing, venue costs, specialist review and other categories are explicitly not supplied. It is not a quote, real funding or a complete budget.

The gallery now reads the case registry rather than a hardcoded single case. Search, OR category filtering, name/date sort, recent views, collection, archive/restore and mobile sidebar operate across both cases without modifying legacy personal-work storage. Production checks accept an honest draft but forbid publishing art-incomplete metadata.

## Reproduction and safeguards

Run from `design-buddy-home`:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5174 --strictPort`
- `npm run build:pantry-notes` (uses `PANTRY_BASE_URL`, default `http://127.0.0.1:5174`)
- `npm run check:templates` verifies the new catalog, source counts, distinct actual JPEGs and SHA-256 asset manifest. Drafts may exist but cannot count as published. Missing/corrupt originals block production builds.
- `npm run build:open-shelf` and `npm run test:open-shelf` build and exercise the independent second draft (`OPEN_SHELF_BASE_URL`, default port 5174).
- `npm run test:pantry-cache` verifies old-cache migration and both actual offline case reloads.
- `npm run test:pantry-notes` exercises browser behaviour, per-page fit, editing, downloads, real touch and direct-file offline source.
- `npm run test:template-office` requires the optional LibreOffice kit at `.cache/office/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/libreoffice-kit/lib/index.js`, or `OFFICE_KIT_MODULE`; it runs real LibreOffice core, not Microsoft Office GUI.
- `npm run build` runs integrity checks before compiling.

The browser helper automatically extracts packaged Chromium runtime libraries into ignored `.cache/`. Source, primary JPEGs, export files and manifests must be in a verified Git checkpoint. Confirm the remote current-branch commit after pushing; do not rely only on a live process or the platform workspace snapshot. Old catalog and personal storage must not be deleted to make a clean-looking rebuild.

The service worker uses exact-request network-first caching, keeps unrelated caches, and never substitutes homepage HTML for a missing work/module. Versioned gallery and case modules prevent old unversioned caches from replacing new content.

## Next

Author a genuinely different third case with the latest reference’s ivory/pale-sage fine-line watercolour. Each case needs 28–35 pages and 15–20 independent main illustrations before publication. The remaining 54 cases are not authored. Do not count reused placements, supporting diagrams or draft shells as completed cases or extra primary art. Keep verified GitHub checkpoints including the actual JPEGs, source and reproducible exports.

## Published case verification

PANTRY NOTES passes eight browser groups, OPEN SHELF passes nine, and five old-worker/offline checks pass. Real LibreOffice renders both native-text PPTX files to 32 pages each. Production build passes both manifests and preserves byte-identical atelier source/production copies. Both cases have 16 primary illustrations and meet their art gates. The OPEN SHELF v2 viewer and registry v4 bypass poisoned v1 draft modules, including the actual final artwork on offline reload. The versioned viewer/gallery bypass poisoned old draft modules, and the final illustration loads correctly on an offline reload. Regenerable Office/browser evidence is in ignored `.cache/pantry-notes/` and can be regenerated.

The existing history already on this same remote branch is merged without replacing the rebuilt template page with its legacy catalog. Those historical sources are retained; they are not counted as new completed cases.

Export PDFs/PPTX/source archives currently remain in Git as requested deliverables. Before broad expansion, plan artifact generation/storage rather than duplicating these binaries indefinitely; preserve primary art and reproducibility and respect the workspace snapshot size limit.
